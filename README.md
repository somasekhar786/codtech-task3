## Overview of the project

### Project: join practice

## Objective

 **INNER JOIN**:

Finds records with matching values in both tables.

*Example*: Employees with their matching departments.

**LEFT JOIN**:

Finds all records from the left table and matched ones from the right table. Unmatched records from the right table will be NULL.

*Example*: All employees, showing their departments if they have one.

**RIGHT JOIN**:

Finds all records from the right table and matched ones from the left table. Unmatched records from the left table will be NULL.

*Example*: All departments, showing employees if they have any.

**FULL JOIN**:

Finds all records with matches in either table. Unmatched records from both tables will be NULL.

*Example*: All employees and departments, showing unmatched records from both.

### Key Activities

**Table Setup**:

Create sample tables (e.g., Employees and Departments).

Populate them with data.

**Writing Join Queries**:

Practice writing INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOIN queries.

**Running Queries**:

Execute the queries to see how the data combines.

**Analyzing Results**:

Understand the output and identify how each join type works.

**Documenting Outputs**:

Capture the query results for review and analysis.

**Explaining Use Cases**:

Describe when and why to use each join type.

### technologies used

- **mysql**:an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used 
            for web applications and small to medium-sized projects.

- **oracle**:a commercial relational database management system developed by Oracle

**Complete & Incomplete Data**: Joins help find both matched and unmatched data.

**Enhanced Analysis**: Joins provide a deeper understanding for data analysis.
