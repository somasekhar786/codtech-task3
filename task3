In this join practices task i have taken the example of library manangement system
database to practices the joins
as you can see these are the types of joins
by using the syntax of joins we have implemented the some examples

INNER JOIN:
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
example:
select books.book_id ,transactions.book_id  from books 
inner join transactions   on books.book_id=transactions.book_id;

LEFT JOIN:
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
example:
select books.book_id ,transactions.book_id  from books 
left join transactions   on books.book_id=transactions.book_id;

RIGHT JOIN:
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

example:
select members.first_name,transactions.book_id from members
right join transactions   on members.member_id=transactions.member_id;

FULL OUTER JOIN OR FULL JOIN:
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column 
union 
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

example:
select members.first_name,transactions.book_id from members
right join transactions   on members.member_id=transactions.member_id
union
select members.first_name,transactions.book_id from members
right join transactions   on members.member_id=transactions.member_id;

CROSS JOIN:
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
example:
select books.book_id,transactions.book_id from books cross join transactions;

SELF JOIN:
syntax:
SELECT 
    alias1.column1, 
    alias1.column2, 
    alias2.column1, 
    alias2.column2 
FROM 
    table_name alias1
JOIN 
    table_name alias2 ON alias1.common_column = alias2.common_column
WHERE 
    condition;

example:
SELECT 
    t1.transaction_id AS Transaction1_ID, 
    t1.book_id AS Book_ID, 
    t1.member_id AS Member1_ID, 
    t2.transaction_id AS Transaction2_ID, 
    t2.member_id AS Member2_ID
FROM 
    transactions t1
JOIN 
    transactions t2 ON t1.book_id = t2.book_id AND t1.transaction_id <> t2.transaction_id;
